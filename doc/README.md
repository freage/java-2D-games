There is an UML diagram showing the relations between the classes. The obvious MVC-relations between the Model, the View and the Controller are not included, to avoid having the diagram cluttered with relation lines.

The multithreading safety reasoning is in [a separate file](multithreading.md).

The levels in the "advanced snake" are described in [a separate file](snakelevels.md).

Details of parts of the design are described in [a separate file](design.md).
